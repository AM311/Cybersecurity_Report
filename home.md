## Working locally with Git

Using the command line, you can easily integrate Git into your current workflow.

### Creating a local copy of the repository

Before we can work locally, we will need to create a clone of the repository.

When you clone a repository you are creating a copy of everything in that repository, including its history. This is one of the benefits of a DVCS like git - rather than being required to query a slow centralized server to review the commit history, queries are run locally and are lightning fast.

Let's go ahead and clone the class repository to your local desktop.
